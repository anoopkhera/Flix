### Notes
When creating the detailed views of the movies, I noticed some of the movies did not have backdrop posters associated with them. This resulted in an error occuring when clicking on the movie. To fix this, I added some error handling to prevent the app from breaking if a movie without a backdrop view is clicked.

### Notes
While developing this app I experienced some issues with installing and working with different pods through CocoaPods. After reading some documentation, I was able to successfully install and use the AlamofireImage pod to add movie poster images within the application.
